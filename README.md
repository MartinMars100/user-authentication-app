This app is from the Treehouse Course, User Authentication With
Express and Node.

Welcome to User Authentication with Express and Mongo DB.
This App demonstrates how to add a user sign up and log in form to a website.
This will let you password protect parts of a site and
limit access for only those visitors who have an account and are signed in.
And when you know who's signed in, you'll be able to customize the experience for
each of your site's visitors.
